Hi there!

Welcome to my project on decile-based trading strategies using the Topix index, which includes around 2100 stocks. Developed in my free time, this project explores simple decile-based trading strategies by analyzing Price-to-Book (PB) ratios. The dataset, sourced from Reuters, was used to sort Topix index stocks by PB ratios, compute market value weights for the top and bottom deciles, and evaluate a long-short strategy based on decile weight and price changes over time.

Feel free to explore the project and share any comments or recommendations!

Cheers,

Lorenzo
